# Webpack 4 Examples

Examples of various webpack configs, generally increasing in complexity.

For each subdirectory:

- `npm install`

For 01:

- `./node_modules/.bin/webpack`

For 02 - 03:
- `./node_modules/.bin/webpack --config=webpack.config.js`

For 04-14: 

- `npm start` (examples 04 - 14)

# Note:

- Example 13 (DLLs) is currently a bit broken.  It doesn't properly exclude jquery from the main application bundle.
